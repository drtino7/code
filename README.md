<h2>PYTHON</h2>
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that emphasizes readability and simplicity. It supports multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, procedural, and imperative. It is widely used for data analysis, web development, scripting, automation, and more.

Some of the Python code snippets and projects in this repository are:

Hello World: A simple program that prints “Hello, World!” to the standard output.
Fibonacci: A program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number using recursion.
Hangman: A text-based game that lets the user guess a random word letter by letter.
Tic Tac Toe: A graphical game that lets two players take turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O symbols.
Calculator: A graphical application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

<h2>C++</h2>

C++ is a compiled, low-level, and general-purpose programming language that supports multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, procedural, generic, and functional. It is an extension of the C language with additional features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exceptions. It is widely used for system programming, game development, embedded systems, and more.

Some of the C++ code snippets and projects in this repository are:

Hello World: A simple program that prints “Hello, World!” to the standard output.
Factorial: A program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
Bubble Sort: A program that sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.
Binary Search Tree: A program that implements a binary search tree data structure with operations such as insertion, deletion, search, traversal, and height.
Snake Game: A graphical game that lets the user control a snake that grows longer as it eats food items on the screen.

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>

JavaScript is an interpreted, high-level, and dynamic programming language that follows the prototype-based paradigm. It is mainly used for web development to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. It can also be used for server-side development using frameworks such as Node.js. It supports multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, event-driven, and imperative.

Some of the JavaScript code snippets and projects in this repository are:

Hello World: A simple program that prints “Hello, World!” to the web console.
Anagram: A program that checks if two given strings are anagrams or not by comparing their sorted versions.
Merge Sort: A program that sorts an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.
Stack: A program that implements a stack data structure with operations such as push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and size.
Todo List App: A web application that lets the user create and manage a list of tasks.

<h2>HTML</h2>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that defines the structure and content of web pages. It uses tags to specify different elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, links, forms, and more. It is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications.

Some of the HTML code snippets and projects in this repository are:

Hello World: A simple web page that displays “Hello, World!” as a heading.
Resume: A web page that displays a resume with personal information, education, skills, work experience, and hobbies.
Calculator: A web page that displays a calculator with buttons for digits and operators.
Gallery: A web page that displays a gallery of images with captions and links.
Quiz: A web page that displays a quiz with multiple choice questions and feedback.

<h2>CSS</h2>

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that describes the presentation and layout of web pages. It uses rules to specify how HTML elements should look like in terms of colors, fonts, backgrounds, borders, margins, padding, alignment, and more. It is used to enhance the appearance and usability of web pages and web applications.

Some of the CSS code snippets and projects in this repository are:

Hello World: A style sheet that applies some basic styles to the hello world web page.
Resume: A style sheet that applies some advanced styles to the resume web page.
Calculator: A style sheet that applies some grid and flexbox styles to the calculator web page.
Gallery: A style sheet that applies some animation and transition styles to the gallery web page.
Quiz: A style sheet that applies some responsive and media query styles to the quiz web page.
