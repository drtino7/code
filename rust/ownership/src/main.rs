fn main() {
  //when creating string the str id not holding the string, only metadata and pointer of the real
  //string. so if whe do this string = String::from("hello"); and string1 = string; then}
  // rust will drop string becose there only can be one owner for a variable. anyway we can do 
  // string1 = string1.clone(); to clone the entire str
